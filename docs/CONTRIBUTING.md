cBathy Contribution Guidlines
=============================

If you're here, that means you're considering contributing. 
That's exciting and we're glad you're here!  This is an open and welcoming community but to keep some semblance of order, 
a few rules and suggestions for contributions.  :) 

Please see the [CODE_OF_CONDUCT](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT) 
other external links we should include here

Git Development Conventions:
----------------------------
The rules for new feature enhancement is laid out below 

- The main branch for releases is `master`.  Each new release is marked with a tag for release.

- The main development branch is `development`.  

- Each new feature is developed on a `[new feature]` branch. 

if you're not comfortable developing in the main repository, you can try forking.  We do ask that when you've made developments
that do still submit a pull request from your forked repository back to the main (upstream) repository. 

Each new release (version) is merged after extensive testing proceedures listed below.  


Testing Proceedure 
------------------
Lay out testing proceedure here 
(We would love for someone to develop automated testing environemnt)

**Merging from `[new feature]` to `development` for enhancement** 
We currently do not have an automated testing environment for each pull request.  There are manual tests that are run when
merging from `[new feature]` to `development`.  

**Merging from `development` to `master` for new release** 
New releases need to be throughly vetted ... list proceedure here

TODOs 
-----
We have a list of contributions that people who are new to the community (or seasoned verterans) 
Currently they're in the issues tab, but if people have other suggestions we're open to suggestions 
We've tried to create tags that help users identify contributions that they can make based on their comfortablity with the status

Comments Required
-----------------
Please comment code thoroughly and professionally

Variable name convention
------------------------
please use explicit variable names so others can understand the variable name (don't be worried about variable name length)
it's better to have a variable name like `significantWaveHeight` instead of `H`.  It is more clear. 

Please see established coding conventions from the WIKI page that include variable name convention
https://github.com/Coastal-Imaging-Research-Network/Forum-Wiki/wiki/Coding-Standards

_establish variable name convention (camel humps? underscores? others?)_

Changing Role
-------------
Explain to users how to change role from _member_ to _contributor_ to _developer_
